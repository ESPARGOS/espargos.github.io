### ESPARGOS Controller Recovery Image
If you have lost access to the ESPARGOS web interface and factory-resetting ESPARGOS is not working either,
you need to perform a full recovery image download.

Follow these steps:
* Connect your ESPARGOS device to the computer via USB.
* ESPARGOS will appear as a serial port. Make sure you get access to this serial port from your WebUSB-enabled browser.
* Use ESP Launchpad (this page) to flash the latest / stable recovery firmware to ESPARGOS. This will also reset ESPARGOS to factory settings.
* You should now re-gain access to the ESPARGOS web interface.
* From there, you may proceed to perform sensor firmware recovery (if necessary).
