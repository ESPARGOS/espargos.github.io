The tachymeter was used to create multiple pointcloud scans.
During the measurement campaign, i.e., while the robot was moving, the tachymeter was stationed outside of the measurement area, but was moved there for making the pointcloud scan.
The coordinate system of the pointlcoud is the same coordinate system that was also used for the rest of the dataset (datapoint positions, antenna array positions).
We achieve this using some reference position markers in the room.
Due to small errors in the measurement of these reference positions, there might also be small errors in the pointcloud coordinates.

The pointclouds are available for download as `.pts` files inside a `.tar.xz` archive.
The following pointcloud scans are available:

* `with-wall-wood.pts`: Pointcloud for configuration variant with metal wall. The tachymeter was stationed on the "wooden" site of the wall, i.e., between metal wall and antenna array.
* `with-wall-metal.pts`: Pointcloud for configuration variant with metal wall. The tachymeter was stationed on the "metallic" site of the wall, i.e., between metal wall and lab room door.
* `no-wall.pts`: Pointcloud for configuration variant without metal wall

PTS files are simple text files with the following format:
* The first line contains the number of datapoints in the scan
* The other lines contain `(x, y, z)` coordinates, reflection intensity and `(r, g, b)` color, e.g.:
```
x      y        z       i    r   g   b
